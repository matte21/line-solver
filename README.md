LINE is an open source solver to analyze queueing models via analytical methods and simulation. The tool features algorithms for the solution of open queueing systems (e.g., M/M/1, M/M/k, M/G/1, ...), open and closed queueing networks, and layered queueing networks. LINE can be run as a royalty-free [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/linemcr/cli) or interactively as a MATLAB toolbox. A [Java version](https://github.com/imperial-qore/line-solver-java) is currently under development. Additional information is available in the [LINE wiki](https://github.com/imperial-qore/line-solver/wiki).

### Getting started

To install LINE, first expand the archive (or clone the repository) in the chosen installation folder. Then start MATLAB, change the active directory to the installation folder and run:
```
lineInstall
```
To begin using LINE, add all LINE folders to the path using the following command:
```
lineStart
```
The last command is required at the beginning of every MATLAB session. You can now use LINE. 

For example, to solve a basic M/M/1 queue analytically, type:
```
model = Network('M/M/1');
source = Source(model, 'mySource');
queue = Queue(model, 'myQueue', SchedStrategy.FCFS);
sink = Sink(model, 'mySink');

oclass = OpenClass(model, 'myClass');
source.setArrival(oclass, Exp(1));
queue.setService(oclass, Exp(2));

model.link(Network.serialRouting(source,queue,sink));

AvgTable = SolverMVA(model).getAvgTable
```
This will provide the following output, showing for example a 50% utilization value:
```
MVA analysis (method: default) completed. Runtime: 0.002546 seconds. Iterations: 1.
AvgTable =
  2Ã—8 table

    mySource    myClass      0        0       0        0        0       1  
    myQueue     myClass      1      0.5       1        1        1       1  
```
